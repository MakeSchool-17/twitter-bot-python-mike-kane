										Things Done Changed
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Pitching pennies, honeys had the high-top jellies
Shooting skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Lounging at the barbecues, drinking brews
With the neighborhood crews, hanging on the avenues
Turn your pages to 1993
Niggas is getting smoked, G: believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggas ain't having that shit
Toting Tecs for rep
Smoking blunts in the project hallways
Shooting dice all day
Wait for niggas to step up on some fighting shit
We get hype and shit and start lighting shit
So step away with your fist-fight ways
Motherfucker, this ain't back in the days
But you don't hear me though

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

No more coco-levio 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3... all it is to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seeing bodies with the motherfucking chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit, too
For the stupid motherfuckers want to try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrapping
Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat want to leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now, they even fucking scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eating 5 cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from
And now the shit's getting crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky brand pagers
Going out of town, blowing up
Six months later, all the dead bodies showing up
It make me wanna grab the 9 and the shotty
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts
Every time I turn around, a nigga getting took out
Shit, my Momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

											Gimme The Loot
Yeah, mothafuckas better know
I'm a bad bad bad
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls

My man Inf left a Tec and a 9 at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A 1-to-3, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G: you with me?

Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest

No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'mma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckas since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same .45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing, it's so hard

Yes love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant

I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my Gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?

When he's sticking you and taking all of your money

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad) 
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent

Goodness gracious, the papers!
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip

One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckas better strip, (yeah nigga, peel)
Before you find out how blue steel feel

From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it

Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka

So go get your man bitch, he can get robbed too

Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it

Hey bitch, hey bitch, gimme your money bitch (when he's sticking you and taking all your money)

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

Man listen, all this walking is hurting my feet
Ooh money looks sweet

Where?

In the Isuzu jeep

Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar

Ooh Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the Gat

Yo chill shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot

Oh shit the cops

Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts

So why the fuck he keep looking?

I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucka going out for the loot

Take that motherfuckers


										Machine Gun Funk
So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore
Appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one
Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking blunts by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"

All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From staying in my business, what is this, relentless
Approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the *blue suits*
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head, cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, baby

"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"

So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy: the place where my head rests
50-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
"What's love got to do"?
When I'm ripping all through your whole crew
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack life
Making money, smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby

												Warning
Who the fuck is this? Paging me at 5:46
In the morning, crack of dawn and
Now I'm yawning, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this paging me and why?
It's my nigga Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper

Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?

Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect

I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggas
That you knew from back when, when you was clocking minor figures
Now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warning me cause now I'm warning you
I got the Mac, nigga tell me what you gonna do

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper 

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The Fifth Corridor

Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singing and flower bringing
If my burglar alarm starts ringing
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals trying to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck! What I'mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket - he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on you rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you?
I'm not running, nigga I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody coming


											Ready To Die
Yeah, you ready motherfucker?
We gonna kill your ass

As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome, homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The Q-45, Glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die!

As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
Getting paid is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, ready

I'm ready to die!

Nah we ain't gonna kill your ass yet
We gonna make you suffer

In a sec, I throw the tec to your fucking neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some rec
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talking
You better act like CeCe and keep on walking
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, with stompin'
I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee, to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggas say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking cheek drip
The shit I kick, ripping through the vest
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die!

I'm ready
(Time to go, we gonna put you out your misery motherfucker)
Niggas definitely know what time it is
The Notorious one in full effect
For ninety-three!
Suicidal, I'm ready!

(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Yeah
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
(If I should die before I wake)
(I pray the Lord my soul to take)
(Cause I'm ready to die)

(All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to)

(Biggie Smalls the biggest man)
(Rocking on and on in ninety-three, Easy Mo Bee)
(Third Eye, and the rest of the Bad Boy fam)
(I don't wanna see no crying at my funeral)






												One More Chance
All you hoes calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that mommy?

Hi Daddy, how you doing, this is Tyiest. I was thinking about you last night. Mm you actin' like you can't call me no more cause you busy n all that, but you trying to tell me it wasn't good?

That shit is real fucked up what you did! I hooked you up with my girl and shit you fucked her every time you see her, you don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying! And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you, "why the fuck Big don't want me?"

Yo Big this is Quita, Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her. You fucked with me last night, that's my best friend and we don't get down like that!

Yeah motherfucker this is Stephanie. I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour. I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me, you be disappearing and shit, and I'm waiting in the cold. What the fuck is going on? When you get in give me a fucking call alright?

When it comes to sex, I’m similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me "Bigga the Condom Filler"
Whether it’s stiff tongue or stiff dick, Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit
Now check this shit:
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd
Smith -- I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I’m not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens -- know what I mean?
I’ll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don’t get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn’t matter: skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a .44
For niggas getting mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G
You see, all I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed:
I’m guaranteed to fuck her ’til her nose bleed
Even if your new man’s a certified mack
You’ll get that H-Town in ya: you want that old thing back

Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
(I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?)

Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn’t last
I’m glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past: let’s dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with benjamins
Another honey’s in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
‘Cause y’all don’t know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex -- and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don’t chase 'em, I replace 'em, and if I’m caressing 'em I’m undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who’s the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke or Tattoo
I got you wrapped around my dick, and when I nut I got to split (shit)
Backshots is my position, I got you wishing for an intermission
Fuck the kissin'
Lick you down to your belly button, I ain’t frontin’
They don’t call me big for nuttin’
All of a sudden

Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
(I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?)




										The What
I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold and that, what you talkin' bout Willis
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless, guns I like em stainless steel
I want the fucking Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze Gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt M.E
{Meth}...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
You don't want to fuck with the me

I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking, you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga, you won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kicking down your goddamn door
(And it goes a little something like this)

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
Honeys shake your hips, you don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on

Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, putting niggas back in I.C.U
I'm lifted troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle-man, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
[Notorious B.I.G.] (Assume the position)
[Method Man] Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Bitch

Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the Winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
[Method Man] I got more Glocks and Tecs than you
[Notorious BIG] I make it hot
[Method Man] niggas won't even stand next to you)
[Notorious BIG] Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
Honeys shake your hips, you don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on


											Everyday Struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't living so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew, flipping over 6 to 2s
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20 down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryna stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle

I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, "Who's next?"
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally lounging black
Sitting back, counting double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch, swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks, I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryna see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'mma mould her now
Trick a little dough buying young girls fringes
Dealing with the dope fiend binges, seeing syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, bagging five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had the first and the third, rehearse that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a Tec with air holes

And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, mothafucka
(Hah, come on, what you say)





											Me and My Bitch
Yo let, let, let me ask you a question yo
Yo would you kill for me?
Hmmm... yeah
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch?

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tripped a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Just me and my bitch 

Just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch

But you know you love that ass, don't you?

Yeah, no question

No question

Yo, let me ask you another question

What?
You ever fuck around on me?
Why would I do that?
Yo don't lie to me motherfucker

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin die together

Just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch

Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your ass fuckin around
I'mma cut your mother-fuckin dick off
Hah, heheh stop playin, hah
I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes
Yo, don- don't play with my dick

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch

Just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch


											Big Poppa
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?
The back of the club sipping Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, macking hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question asking, blunt passing
Music blasting, but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep wit'
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over, tell your friends jump in the GS3
I got the chronic by the tree

(I love it when you call me big poppa)
Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
To the honies getting money playing niggas like dummies
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! (why?)
Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby, baby

Straight up honey really I'm asking
Most of these niggas think they be macking, but they be acting
Who they attracting with that line, "What's your name, what's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo? (True)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the Jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me

(I love it when you call me big poppa)
Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
To the honies getting money playing niggas like dummies
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! (why?)
Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby, baby

(How you living, Biggie Smalls?) In mansion and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote Gats strapped with infrared beams
Chopping O's, smoking la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

Honey, check it
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with you?
Yeah....keep bangin'

(I love it when you call me big poppa)
Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
To the honies getting money playing niggas like dummies
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! (why?)
Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby, baby






												Respect
Nineteen-seventy something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team:
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream!
I mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Peep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
If I'm pimping on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the Tec
Respect to the macks in the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps

Now this is Diana King
Doing a Yankee thing
In a Biggie Small's thing
Do it, Ja!

Have Mercy!
The gunman in all de party
And everybody feel irie.
And everybody just follow me, follow me, follow me!

Have Mercy!
The gunman in all de party
And everybody feel irie.
And everybody just follow me, follow me, follow me!







										Friend of Mine
Fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my niggas know
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, Gucci Don, you know how we play
Fuckin scandalous-ass bitches; you know how it go, Gooch
I meet a bitch, fuck a bitch
Next thing you know you fuckin the bitch
You just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like a cold and shit
Fuck 'em

Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
Cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door
[You know] they might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said (Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?)
Thug nigga until the end, tell a friend bitch
Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch
[And you know that ain't right]

You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine

You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
(Yeah we know, drop the scenario)
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right

You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine

Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine



								Unbelievable
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats I pull it
Bastards duckin' when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom, fucking
It ain't nothing, they know BIG be handling
With the Mac in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q-45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast you but I have to, you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame and them fucking polka dots
Who rock the spot, Biggie
You know how the weed go, unbelievable

It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest


B-I-G, G-I-E, A.K.A., B.I.G
Get it, Biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers can't sleep
Need sleeping Big keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking
Casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A - don't fuck with B-I, that's that
Oh I, thought he was wack, oh come come now
Why y'all so dumb now, hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer saute, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
He sounds demented, car weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil or unbelievable

It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest

Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play guerilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice, for the nicest MC
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable





										Suicidal Thoughts
Hello, aw shit nigga, what the fuck time is it
Oh goddamn, nigga do you know what time it is
Aw shit, what the fuck is going on
You alright, nigga what the fuck is wrong with you

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
It don't make sense, going to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleeping all day, no getting my dick licked
Hanging with the goodie-goodies lounging in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
(You talking some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
(Get a hold of yourself nigga)
Sucking on her chest just to stop my fucking hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them
(Naw nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
(Nigga what the fuck)
And squeeze, until the bed's completely red
(It's too late for this shit man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fucking buddha head
The stress is building up, I can't
(Yo, I'm on my way over there man)
I can't believe suicide's on my fucking mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling me
Naw you wouldn't understand
(Nigga talk to me please, man)
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no coming back
(Yo, I'mma call you when I get in the car)
Should I die on the train track, like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral fronting like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
(Put your girl on the phone, nigga)
She knew me and her sister had something going on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
(Yo, you listening to me motherfucker)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
(Eyo c'mon nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talking
(BANG)

Ayo Big, ayo Big

Just Playing (Dreams)
As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti LaBelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
Them jeans they fitting like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses, I'mma show you who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
Pimping ain't easy but it sure is fun
When I bust my nuts I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun?


Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying


I'll put Chante Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck RuPaul before I fuck them ugly ass Xscape bitches
You can 76 the 69, try 68
Make Raven-Symoné call date rape
Only cause Im paid, I'm fucking all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say:
"Everybody move your body"
Got Whitney Houston boosting from Bobby
As I bust the cherry of Monica and Terry
Backshots to Chaka, I know that pussy hairy
Sade, ooh, I know that pussy tight
Smack Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke a stoge, fucking En Vogue because it's four of them
Jimmy hats for Patra, I'm using all of them
(What about Toni Braxton?)
If that bitch give me action...guaranteed satisfaction

Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying







Juicy
Fuck all y'all, hoes 
Get a grip, motherfucker 
Yeah, this album is dedicated 
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothing 
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustling in front of 
That called the police on me 
When I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter 
And all the niggas in the struggle 
You know what I'm saying 
It's all good baby baby 

It was all a dream 
I used to read Word Up! magazine 
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine 
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed on Bambu, sipping on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)
It's all good (it's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Putting 5 karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh ... and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all... (It's all good)
...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty
